MidiGAL firmware update steps:

1.	Connect MIDI interface output to MidiGAL's MIDI IN
2.	Power on MidiGAL while holding down the encoder. MIDI LEDs will blink shortly then MIDI IN LED will stay lit. 
    The display will remain blank or contain a line of box characters.
4.	Send firmware update sysex file (*.syx) to your MIDI interface port with 250ms delay between sysex buffers.
    Elektron's C6 works great on OS X and Windows. Classic MIDI-OX is also good on Windows. 
    MIDI LEDs will be blinking while firmware sysex is being received.
5.	Firmware update takes a couple of minutes, MidiGAL will automatically reset when update is done.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if your MidiGAL originally came with MIDIpal firmware, please use firmware sysex file with _pal.syx 
suffix. These files are formatted for MIDIpal boot loader, whereas regular .syx files are formatted for MidiGAL 
bootloader.
